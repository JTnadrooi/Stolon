Stele - (stem, or can be seen as gravemarker, rather grim.)
Xylem - (stem, starts with an X, I dislike that (ALT: SCYLEM))
Stolon - (Some kind of plantroot able to sprout more plants. Clonal colony reference.)
Clonal Colony - (Just a weird name for a game, makes it sound like a game thats not a c4 game.)

The towers in the STOLON P.O.E(LON) are refered to as a "RAMET" (Meaning an individual in a clonal colony - the towers grow like plants and are all conected, much like the Pando tree in Utah.)
IIA diamond - (A stronger diamond, not quite a game name but will be used elsewhere.)
