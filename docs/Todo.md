# Todo

For future _Stolon_ commits.

-   Implement [patern matching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching) to all if statements that could use it.
-   Add more splashtexts.
-   Improve the `Asitlib.Debug` namespace.
    -   Add a interupt system.
    -   Add a better indenting system.
-   Allow the `FunctionHeap` to support return values. - done.
-   Make it so I dont need to call `RegisterEntity()` every time I wish to register an entity.
-   Make it so I dont need to call `AddOverlay()` every time I wish to add an overlay.
-   Implement [Camera 2D](https://github.com/DeanReynolds/Dcrew.MonoGame.2D-Camera). (Also for stationary backgrounds.)
-   ~~Maybe use a real UI libary.~~ _(no)_
-   Make a `IGameComponent` interface for classes like the `UserInterface`, `Environment` and `Board` classes.
    -   And then add a way to individually load `IGameComponent` classes.
-   Make some classes `abstract`.
-   Release _Asitlib_ or at least the `AsitLib.Debug` namespace.
-   Clean the `AsitLib.XNA` namespace.
-   Make this a checklist instead of an enumeration.
-   Document **everything**. (+ externally.)
    -   And put an checklist of what to document here.
-   Add a loading screen.
-   Modding support.
-   Streamline the _Stolon.cs_ file.
    -   Including its connection with the _Environment.cs_ file.

These will mostly be done in the background, although they will each get their own commits.
